		<h1>about graft</h1>

		<p>graft is a static file preprocessor made in go</p>

		<h2>why is it useful</h2>

		<p>
			imagine this, youre making a website, you need to make the 50th page
			of your blog, so you duplicate your previous blog posts html file.
			after finishing your 50th blog post, you realize that its time for a
			new header, but... oh no! you have to edit every single file and its
			header!
		</p>

		<p>
			guess what you can do with graft. its basically a non-runtime
			templating engine so you can just have a
			<code>header.html</code> then in your <code>base.html</code> file
			you can include your <code>header.html</code> like
			<code>&lt;g-include src="header.html" /&gt;</code> and voila! all
			your pages include only a reference to your header instead of a
			complete copy of it.
		</p>

		<p>
			you can also use the extend command to do templating, you can have a
			<code>base.html</code> with a bunch of
			<code>&lt;g-block name="[name]" /&gt;</code> commands and then in
			your <code>index.html</code> file have a
			<code>&lt;g-extend src="base.html"&gt;</code> command with
			<code>&lt;g-define name="[name]"&gt;</code> commands and voila
			again! all your pages all have the same underlying html structure
		</p>

		<h2>why use graft instead of a templating engine</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>any language.</b> it works on any text. its not html only,
				markdown only, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>no runtime.</b> everything is processed at build time. it
				only outputs plain files and theres no dependancies after its
				built
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>user commands.</b> many preprocessors hardcode behavior, but
				graft commands are go code and written by the user. you can
				build anything into graft you want
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>tree based.</b> since commands rewrite an AST, it makes it
				easy to build complex transformations and extensions
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>very hackable.</b> there is a preset package which will let
				you get quickstarted but if you need more customization, you can
				drop to a lower level and deal with the tokenizer and parser
				yourself
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>very lightweight.</b> other templating engines can be very
				heavy, especially since many are runtime based. which means a
				worse experience for users because of website loading times
			</li>
		</ul>
